# MyMagLev
Yet another magnetic levitation project. This is my implementation!

<i>LEVITATIO NON DISPUTANDUM EST!</i>

As you can see the main difference between mine and similar projects is the position of hall sensor. 

Usually it is placed just below electromagnet  with its sensing face pointing down.
It would be the best solution, but it **didn't work** for me!
Magnetic field generated by electromagnet was detected by hall sensor, so that it was not able to measure levitating magnet position correctly.
For this reason I finally came with the idea to place sensor under levitating magnet (with sensing face pointing up). This way hall sensor 
is free from electromagnet interference.
